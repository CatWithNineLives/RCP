# The Road Coloring Problem

I carried out this project to first read the paper, 'The Road Coloring Problem' conjectured by  Roy Adler and Benjamin Weiss (1970) and proved by Avraham Trahtman(2009) and then wrote a real life application for it by taking the the roads around campus as edges and several landmarks as nodes. The problem deals with finding the synchronising coloring for a particular type of graph, such that no matter which node on the graph you start from , you shall always reach the same destination if you follow the coloring.
